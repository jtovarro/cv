### Alba Gómez - Technical Graduate

Thank you for all the help and support during my first year at Red Hat. I really appreciate your confidence in me, giving me the opportunity to participe in real proyects to learn more about the day to day work. 

Also, thank you for all the time you have spent teaching me new technologies, as well as getting me involved in calls with your team to meet more Red Hatters. I am sure you will achieve all your goals :)

### Javier León - Consultant

I think Juan Carlos has made a huge progress since he started as a junior consultant and, in my opinion, he is far above of what you can expect from a junior.

From a skills perspective, he has developed a huge knowledge about Ansible, Openshift, Satellite and RHEL, but he also knows where you can find help when you need it, which is the same or more important. I started to work with him as my shadowee and he was exactly what you expect from a shadowee, humble, keeping attention and always asking or noting question for later.

I have also worked with him in a gig where he was working alone and I helped them a little bit with Satellite. He knows how to talk and manage clients which is not easy at all. He noted the questions that he didn't know about and tried to help them in every area they needed, even when it wasn't his area of expertise and he needed to look for help. He is capable of carrying solo gigs without issues, an achievement to be proud of for someone who has been working in consulting for a year.

Besides, the best part of him is his attitude, you can tell from the first moment that he is eager to learn new things, he is always studying some certificate or new courses, reaching out to colleagues when he is in PD and trying to find out if there is anything interesting he can learn or help with.

To recap, he just have to continue working like he is doing right now, be a bit brave when facing new challenges and gain some experience because that is the only thing he lacks of.

### Iván Aragones - Senior Consultant

Thanks for your great work automating the IPU processes. It's been a great base to be used in other similar projects. Awesome!

### Fran Garcia - Principal Consultant

Juan Carlos has provided an excellent delivery in the AXA RHEL modernization project, first of a kind project done in the region. His guidance and patience towards a challenging project has driven it to success!

### Adonis Garcia - Consultant

I just have good words to evaluate the work that Juan Carlos is doing in AXA. He just needed a few days of shadowing to take care of the project like he has been leading it from the beginning. I was so surprise how Juan Carlos learned new technologies in a short period of time and his capacity to gain customer’s trust. 

He’s able to manage issues and challenges by himself even though he didn’t have expertise in some areas. That`s one of the best skills he can have as a consultant. 

I’m pretty sure he’s gonna be soon one of our references in consulting. Nothing important to say as improvements, just keep pushing as until now and try to focus your carrer in what you want in order to be a referent person in some technologies/areas.
